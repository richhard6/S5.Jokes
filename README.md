# S5.Jokes
The user can select random jokes from two different APIs and rate the ones he wants to rate.

When the Jokes are rated, they get "saved" from now, in the rated jokes panel. They are saved in 
this panel with their ID as title, if you hover over this ID you will see the joke and how you rated it 
and if you click on one of them it will appear a modal showing the clicked modal information.

In the left side panel you get climate information about your current zone, make sure you let the browser do it.

I'm developing it with Bulma for the CSS and TypeScript.
